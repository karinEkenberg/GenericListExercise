# Generic List Exercise

This C# program demonstrates the use of a generic list to store and print a list of fruits.

## Usage

1. **Run the Program:**
   - Compile and execute the program using a C# development environment.

2. **Enter the Number of Fruits:**

3. **Input Fruits:**
   - Enter the name of each fruit as prompted by the program.

4. **Display Fruits:**

## Program Logic

- The program utilizes a generic list (`List<T>`) to store and manage the fruits.
- It prompts the user to input the number of fruits they want to add.
- It then allows the user to input the name of each fruit.
- Finally, it prints the list of fruits using a generic method.

## Prerequisites

- A C# development environment.

## Running the Program

1. Open the project in your C# development environment.
2. Build and run the program.
